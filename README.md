# 🎗Lung Cancer Prediction

This project classifies whether a tumor is benign or malignant using classical machine learning models.

---

## Project Description

Using the well-known **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**, we applied classification algorithms to build a model that predicts the type of tumor based on features like cell radius, texture, smoothness, and more.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
-  Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

---

## Steps Followed
1. Loaded the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn
2. Performed data exploration and visualization
3. Normalized features for better model performance
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained multiple classification models
6. Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
7. Compared results and selected the best model

---

## Performance
- Achieved accuracy > 95% using SK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Confusion matrix and classification report were used for evaluation

---

##  Dataset
- Source: Built-in dataset from `[sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/lung-cancer)`
